# Acoustic scattering and forces on an arbitrarily sized fluid sphere by a general acoustic field
## Authors: M. Pess√¥a, A.A.R. Neves 

In the .nb files we describe how we obtained results presented in the paper Acoustic scattering and forces on an arbitrarily sized fluid sphere by a general acoustic field.

Simulations include the scattering of a plane wave emitted on a spherical surface, and the reconstructed beam for an arbitrarily localized Bessel Beam. Also, we calculate the profiles for acoustic radiation force for a plane wave and a Bessel Beam. We also present the convergence for the different expansion coefficients. 

In this repository: 
 - Bessel_PressureField_v1.nb corresponds to the reconstruction of an arbitrarily located Bessel Beam reconstructed by the multipole expansion coefficients.
 - Convergence_V1.nb describes the convergence methods used for- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C_{lm}  " /> .
